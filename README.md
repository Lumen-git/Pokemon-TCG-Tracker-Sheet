# Pokemon TCG Tracker Sheet

This is a simple spreadsheet to keep track of a collection of Pokemon TCG cards. Typically, I would use pokellector.com, however wanting to have a local solution, better variant tracking, and some extra sets/customization not available on the site lead me to making a custom solution. The data in this sheet is collected and organized via a hybrid of pokellector.com and bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net. 

The sheet tracks total cards, as well as shiny and other variants on each sets page. The entire system can be navigated from the home page by using ctrl+click on the set you want to jump too, as well as jumping back. 

I'll try to keep this sheet updated as much as possible, as well as improve it from time to time. In order to update your local copy, just copy over your collections to the new version, or new pages from the new version to your local version. 

As this is an open source project, feel free to alter it in any way you see fit, as well as suggest changes to help all of us!
